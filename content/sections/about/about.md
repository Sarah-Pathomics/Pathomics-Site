For biomedical researchers in pharma and academia, extracting useful information from biomedical images is a time consuming and cost intensive process, with a high likelihood of not getting the right answer out of the existing tools. This is in part due to a need for expert pathologists who are in short supply, and the need for data scientists, many of whom may not understand what the researchers are looking for, leading to long turnaround times that slow down the analysis process. Currently researchers face an uncertain path to their results, with a fractured market where the tools that do exist are complex, not fully automated, and difficult to use.

Our team has already built several tools that convert biological images into the results needed by scientists. We have 10+ years of experience serving clients in this market, and as scientists ourselves, know how to navigate the challenges faced and deliver results. Specifically, our solution:

* Presents complex data in a format that helps researchers understand how their new drug compounds can impact diseases.
* Predicts the type of disease from subtle features present in the image itself.
* Rather than forcing busy clinical pathologists to count cells manually, we automate the process, delivering cell counts in minutes that would have taken hours to count.

We present this information in clear, easy to interpret way, giving scientists the results they need to make clear decisions about next steps in their research.

We hope to become a central resource and information clearinghouse for the collection of open-source tools for the field of computational pathology.

This field has seen explosive growth over the past few years, with the introduction of digital pathology to clinical workflows and research laboratories.

In addition to building computational tools to address the needs of our customers, we also aim to make an inclusive platform to help promote discussion and collaboration, and to most importantly be useful to the community.
